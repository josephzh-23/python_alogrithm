warehouse capacity[i]

where warehouse Capacity[i] represents the capacity of the warehouse located at position/(assuming 1-based indexing).

Connection hub:
    Each warehouse must establish a connection to a distribution hub positioned at a location greater than or equal to its own. This means that a warehouse at position i can only connect to a hub at position j, where j >= i.

Notice that there is also another catch to this


The central high-capacity distrbituion hub puzzle here:
To optimize inventory routing, Amazon has placed a central high-capacity distribution hub at the last warehouse, located at position n. This hub serves as the main connection point for all warehouses if necessary. The cost of establishing a connection from warehouse at i to a hub at position j is given by warehouseCapacity[j] - warehouseCapacity[i].



Cost of establishing a connection:
The cost of establishing a connection from warehouse at i to a hub at position j is given by
warehouseCapacity[j] - warehouseCapacity[i].


The ask:
        Given a queries of the form (hubA, hubB), where two additional high-performance distribution hubs are deployed at warehouses hubA and hubB (1 â‰¤ hubA < hubB < n), the goal is to calculate the minimum total connection cost for all warehouses, considering the nearest available distribution hub at or beyond each warehouse's position.

Input here:
Additional hubs:

additionalHubs = [[2, 4]]
warehouseCapacity [3, 6, 10, 15, 20]

[6]
[3, 6, 10, 15, 20]
j -


1st warehouse will connect to the nearest available distribution hub at position 2, cost incurred 6-3=3
2nd warehouse is itself a distribution hub, so cost incurred = 0
3rd warehouse will connect to the nearest available distribution hub at position 4, cost incurred = 15-10=5
4th and 5th warehouses are itself a distribution hub, so cost incurred = 0+0=0
Thus, the total connection cost (6-3)+(0)+(15-10)+(0)+(0)=8. Hence, return [8] as the answer.
