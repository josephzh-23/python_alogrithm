'''

A very interesting problem here

The array is of a given legnth here and then set to 0 here


To solve this problem, we need a way to efficiently record the changes to each element of the
array over timeâ€”this is done so th
at we can later query the value of an element as it was at any snapshot point.

    '''
    
    The logic behind here 
    1. we append a tuple to the list at that index containing the current snap_id and the new value. This way, 
    we are effectively recording a timeline of values for each index.

        o retrieve a value from a past snapshot, we use binary search (bisect_right) to find the first tuple where the snap_id is greater than the requested snap_id. We then take the previous tuple as it will have the value of the array at the time of the snapshot. If there is no such tuple (i.e., if the index was never set before the snap_id), we return 0.
