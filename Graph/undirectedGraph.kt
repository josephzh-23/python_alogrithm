package Graph

/*

Undirected graph is the same as weighted graph
Use adjacency matrix as said the 2 d situation
matrix[m][n] = 1  means an edge exists between the 2 nodes

    A  B  C
 A  0  1  0             in here, if AB = 1, BA = 0
 B  1  0  1               means an edge from A to B, no edge from B to A
 C  0  0  0
