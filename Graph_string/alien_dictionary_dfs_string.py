This is an important part here

  -   Recall that in a depth-first search, nodes are returned once they either have no outgoing links left, or all their outgoing links have been visited. Therefore, the order in which nodes are returned by the depth-first search will be the reverse of a valid alphabet order.


    - We can reverse the adjacencylist here instead of a forward one here.

    Be careful of graph cycle here
