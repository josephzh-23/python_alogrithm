# Input: s = "00110"
# Output: 1

#
# At each step, the left window's size increases by one and
#  the right window's size decreases by 1.
#  We want to change all the characters in the left window into '0' and all the characters in the right window into '1'.
#
#
# Define variables here:
# Let left1 be the number of '1's in the current left window
# right0 be the number of '0's in the current right window
# left1:

# Then here we have the code
