There r 3 cases to examine

   - traverse down the tree
1. A case with no child node, the leaf node, set it to none


2. A case where deleting node has 2 children node
    1) get mininmum key with in that subtree, same as finding inOrder Successor

    2) recursively delete the successor. Note that the successor
    will have at most one child (right child)

    3) copy value of the successor to the current node

3. A case where the deleting node has  1 child node
     - if the node to be deleted is not a root node, set its parent to it child
