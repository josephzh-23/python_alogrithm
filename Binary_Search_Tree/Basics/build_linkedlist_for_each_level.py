THis is question 4.3 from the cracking coding interview book

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
at each depth

(e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).
This is very simple


Strategy:
    pass in level + 1 to the next recursive call with DFS preorder here as well
'''

# can do this using DFS as given in the example
from Binary_Tree.binaryTree import Node


def createLevelLinkedlistUtil(root, lists, level):

    #base case
    if not root:
        return

    list = []
    # the current level not contained in the list
    if len(lists) == level:
        '''
        I* Levels are always traversed in order. So, if this is the first time we've
    visited level i, we must have seen levels 0 through i - 1. We can
    therefore safely add the level at the end. 
        '''
        lists.append(list)

    else:
        list = lists[level]

    list.append(root)
