'''
What's in order successor again?
node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node. 
        20 
     8      22
   4   12
    10    14

In this case in-order-successor of 8 is 10, 
in-order-successor of 10 is 12. 

This is a linkedlist problem, tough to solve 
 TC: O (h)      there r 2 cases here 
 
 case 1 : node has right subtree
    - travserse deep to leftmost node in right subtree
    or find min in right subtree 
    
 case 2 : no right subtree 
    - traverse down until we reach cur
    - check if we should go left or go right
