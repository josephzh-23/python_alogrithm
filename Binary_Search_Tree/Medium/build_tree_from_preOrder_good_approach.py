'''
This is an improvement from the previous approach

where improved? 
O (n) 

different approach that doesn’t involve searching for an index that 
separates the left and right subtree keys in a preorder sequence:

The concept:
We know that each node has a key that is greater 
than all keys present in its left subtree, 
but less than the keys present in the right subtree of a BST. 

The idea to pass the information regarding 
the valid range of keys for the current root node and 
its children in the recursion itself.
