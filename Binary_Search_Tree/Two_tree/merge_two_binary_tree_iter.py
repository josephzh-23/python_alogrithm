'''
We use as said
Val1 and val2 represent the nodes of tree1 and tree2 respectively.


At each step we remove one pair from the stack and update tree1 in keeping with values within the pair.

2. If the left and right pointer of tree1 isnâ€™t NULL we push them into the stack.

3. If the left child of tree1 is NULL, we update it with the left pointer of tree2.
The same goes for the right pointer.
