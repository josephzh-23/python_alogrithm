1. Definition of height:
    - the longest path from root node to any leaf node


2. to traverse down a tree on the left
cur = cur.left

traverse down right
cur = cur.right


A typical formulat

if key < curr.data:
        curr = curr.left
    else:
        curr = curr.right


2. How to calculate min and max height from num of nodes?

- If there are n nodes in binary tree, maximum height of the binary tree is
n-1 and minimum height is floor(log2n), you round up in this ase.


3. What's the best TC for tree and the worst?
    - usually we want O(h), not O (n), n is the # of nodes
    - with height it can be # of nodes


4.How to calculate min and max # of nodes from height?

    -minimum number of nodes is h+1
    - max # of nodes 2^(h+1)-1
