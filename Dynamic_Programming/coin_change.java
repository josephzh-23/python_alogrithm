Basically break this into a subproblem
1. [1, 3, 4, 5] 		Amt = 7
min coin  should be 2, 	with [ 3 + 4]

At each position the decision is 1, 3, 4, 5
answer = Amount - num picked

[1, 3, 4, 5] 		Amt = 7
Use bottom up approach. Start from the bottom.
So check following,
dp[0] = 0		means whatâ€™s the min # of coins needed to sum to 0, is 0
dp[1] = 1		min# of coins to sum to 1

dp[2] = 2 = 1 + 1 = dp[1] + 1
dp[3] = can take 3 or [1 +2]
dp[4] = 1			// already have a 4 so only takes 1
dp[5] = 1				dp[6] = 2

So consider case for dp[7]
Option 1: at coin 6, add 1			mincost = 3?
dp[7] = 1+ dp[6] 	 this give you 3,since 1+ 2 = 3, not the min # of 						coins though
