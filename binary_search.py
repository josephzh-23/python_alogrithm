"""

Compare x with the middle element.
If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
Else if x is greater than the mid element,
then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element.
Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.

Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half.
So we apply the algorithm for the left half.
