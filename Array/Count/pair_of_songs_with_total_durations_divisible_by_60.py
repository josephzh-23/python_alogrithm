You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

time = [30,20,150,100,40]

(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

Below is the brute force approach here 


(a+b) % 60=0
       â‡“
((a % 60)+(b % 60)) % 60=0

    '''

    Next, we iterate through each song duration in time and calculate its remainder when divided by 60.

0. So basically being between count[(60 - t % 60) and count[t % 60] and that's it
2
1 we then look for other song durations with a remainder of (60 - t % 60) % 60

2.since this would result in a total duration that is divisible by 60.
