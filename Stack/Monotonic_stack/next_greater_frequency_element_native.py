A simple hashing technique is to use values as the index is being used to store the
 frequency of each element.

 Create a list suppose to store the frequency of each number in the array. (Single traversal is required). Now use two loops.
The outer loop picks all the elements one by one.
The inner loop looks for the first element whose frequency
is greater than the frequency of the current element.
If a greater frequency element is found then that element is printed, otherwise -1 is printed.

This would be comparing 1 elem with the rest 1 at the time
Pick elem -> iterate thru loop until get to end and then compare here
